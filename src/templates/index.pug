				p Blockchain technology is ushering in a new era of operational efficiency for capital markets and suite powering commerce and finance, built to optimize business processes and digitize financial instruments. You can create digital representations of conventional securities using Ethereumâ€™s built-in token functionality. Blockchain-based securitization allows you to customize financial instruments and create wholly new digital assets.
				p Programmable assets and securities mean new securities can be issued in minutes, with rights and obligations encoded, so you can increase the velocity of funding events. Costs and simplified fund servicing, accounting, allocation, and administration will decrease overhead and resulting fees across capital markets. Transparent clearing and settlement reduce default and systemic and ensures both ends of a counterparty receive their securities and purchase price in T+0 days.
